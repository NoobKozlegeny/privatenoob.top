              <li>
                <p>
                  Slice the chicken into thin pieces which helps to make it cook
                  more evenly and put it into a bowl
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Create 6 slices of ginger and cop them up to even smaller
                  units or split up some cubes of dried crystallized gingers.
                  Mince 3 cloves of garlic and add both of them to the bowl
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Season them with 1/2 tsp. of salt, black pepper, 1/2 tsp. of
                  baking soda and mix them up
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Slice up some veggies into preferably thing and long pieces,
                  like the carrots and bell peppers. If you wish to use peas,
                  discard the shelling. Split up the scallions into any amount
                  of parts you like.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  SAUCE: 1.5 tbsp of light soy sauce (replaced with dark soy
                  sauce), 1.5 tbsp of dark soy sauce, 1 tbsp of oyster sauce
                  (replaced with dark soy sauce), 1 tbsp hoisin sauce (replaced
                  with sesame oil) 1/2 tbsp of pure peanut butter, and 1/2 cup
                  of water. Note: I recommend atleast getting oyster (more
                  preferred) or hoisin sauce. The lack of these ingredients
                  didn't make my pasta's texture brown enough, not even by
                  adding more soy sauce
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Heat some water up to boil the pasta until it's around 80%
                  done. If it has already achieved the 80% before finishing the
                  veggie and chicken cooking, then drain them completely.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  While boiling the pasta cook the marinaded chicken on a high
                  heat, until they have become white. After that add all the
                  veggies except the greens of the scallions and stir these for
                  1-2 mins. Add the drained noodles to the mix and pour the
                  sauce over it too.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Stir these ingredients as well as you can on a medium heat.
                  The perfect time for finishing with the cooking process is
                  when the sauce has been completely absorbed up by the noodles.
                  Do not let it cook after the sauce have been used up, because
                  then we are going to have a sticky situation.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Sprinkle the majesty with the green scallions and mix it up.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>TASTE THE WONDER! ^^</p>
