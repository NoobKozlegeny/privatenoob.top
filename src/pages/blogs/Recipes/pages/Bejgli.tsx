              <li>
                <p>
                  Put the yeast and yolk into a room temperature milk and stir
                  it a bit
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Put the powdered sugar and flour into a bowl and mix those a
                  bit
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Include the butter to and do another mixing</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Pour the stirred milk mix into the the bowl and mix this until
                  the dough comes off your hands (This will take some time and
                  arm strength)
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Create 4 equally sized dumplings and put these into the fridge
                  while all of them are wrapped in foils (Rest these doughs
                  until you're finished with the fillings)
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Warm up both fillings's milk in a slow cook. If you're
                  finished then isolate half the milk for the walnut filling
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  COCONUT TIMEEEEE! While having the leftover milk in the
                  cooking pot, put the vanillin, coconut, butter (maybe the
                  chocolate too if you want?) then stir them
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Include the salt and the flour into the filling and stir it
                  until they get creamy, but not runny. Add a tiny bit flour if
                  it feels too runny? Do some sample tasting if it needs any
                  tweaks for ya. If you're finished, cover the pot with a lid
                  and let it coool (Skip to walnut filling to save time)
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  After it has cooled down, grate 1 lemon and 1 orange skin into
                  it.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  WALNUT TIMEEEEE! Grab a bowl and put the walnut, cinnamon,
                  vanillin, orange and lemon skin and stir them a bit. It's not
                  necessarily a requirement, but you could have a finely and
                  crudely minced walnut.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Pour the warm milk into them and stir it. Don't let it be too
                  dry or too runny. Do some sample tasting if it needs any
                  tweaks for ya.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  ASSEMBLING TIMEEEEE! Take out 1 dumpling dough, knead them out
                  into a rectangle / square shape if you can (I was only able to
                  make ellipses). The dough's width should be around 5-7 mm.
                  (Using a roller with warm water in the cylinder can help
                  greatly. The dough was really sticky for me ngl)
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Spread half of the walnut or coconut filling on the dough as
                  evenly as you can with leaving 1 cm space on all sides. ONLY
                  FOR THE COCONUT: Smash the chocolate into tiny pieces and
                  sprinkle them on the fillings evenly. Do this for all the 3
                  remaining dumplings
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Press down the left and right edge of the dough with your
                  fingers, then fold those ONCE and press them down a bit again.
                  This one helps to create a better aesthetic look after the
                  baking will finished
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Roll up the from down-to-top gently and lubricate the rolls
                  with 1 egg yolk and put them into the freezer for 15 mins
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Lubricate it with egg whites, wait a bit and just put them
                  into the oven for 200 Celsius in upper-under baking mode to 35
                  minutes (or just watch until it looks tastyyy :3). If you have
                  a modern oven, you probably need to lower the heat to 160 C, I
                  have accidentally ruined this masterpiece

                <p>
                  Don't eat yet hungry fella, just let it rest overnight with a
                  cloth over it.
